# Prototype for SoCraTes Conference App

## Pipeline

Here's what I plan to do:

1. Do the wireframe in Sketch
2. Do the interactions in Framer
3. ...
4. Profit!!! :)

## Wireframes

Wireframes are done in [Sketch](http://www.sketchapp.com).
There's a 30 day free Trial available.

## Interactions

Interactions will be done using [Framer](http://framerjs.com).
There's an 8 hour in-app-evaluation-period for the Desktop App (Mac Only) and the underlying framework is OOS.

## Todos

## Contributing

Well, please do :-)

This prototype is placed upon the [session](https://www.socrates-conference.de/wiki/2016/session_socrates-app) on building it in the 2016 conference.
